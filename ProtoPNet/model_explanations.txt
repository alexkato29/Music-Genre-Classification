best_backbone_426:
This model was trained on the augmented data and had validation accuracy as high as 99.6%. 
There was some indirect form of train test leakage, and I think that it is overfit.

best_backbone_427:
This was trained on the augmented data and has accuracies of ~56% on validation.
I don't see any sign that there was train/val leakage, and this model is probably ok.

best_backbone_256:
This was trained on the new augmentations: pitch shift, noise, high/low pass filter, polarity inversion
Does ok at ~56% accuracy on validation. This model only has one FC layer, so might serve as a better prototype backbone.
